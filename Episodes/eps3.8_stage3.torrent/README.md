Another seemingly quite quiet episode.. lets see.

Observations
--

- 07m48s "From Hunted To Hero" - Tyrell Wellick Article
- 12m01s Romeo Evidence part 1
- 12m01s **102868** Case number
- 12m01s **108-71** Location of Seizure
- 12m19s **Serial numbers - see below** from Romero file
- 15m05s **108** number above door that Irving stops outside
- 22m47s **Weird mosaic** again, with the colours Red, Yellow, and Green being prominent
- 31m44s **Red, Yellow, and Orange** post-its over faces
- 32m00s **Red and Orange phones**
- 32m21s **828** Time on Angela's phone
- 32m53s  Dr Wang is playing/organising a weird card game
- 45m53s Elliot showing The Volatility Foundation pieces of code for doing deep memory forensics (in this case probably adding artefacts to a usb stick for his target)
- 45m53s **192.251.68.228/index** Ip in the Volatility code
- 45m53s **141924** 6 digits seen in code
- 45m53s **39238** Program PID
- 45m55s More code being exampled on Elliot's computer, using evince, and GDB for some reverse engineering
- 45m57s Elliot causing a Segmentation Fault to load his malicious code into
- 46m02s Elliot writing shell code into his binary. Might be worth trying to reverse this.
- 46m02s **ecoin_vuln_notes.pdf** malicious file Elliot is creating
- 46m50s **MAP** small one showing US infections from dark army malware I assume
- 46m54s **172.17.0.1**, **u1rbr0uz.net**
- 46m54s **192.168.5.11** garyhost address
- 46m54s **garyhost** Username Elliot logs into 172.17.0.1 with 
- 46m57s **HUNTER2** A huge easter egg nod to a meme known as hunter2 - Looks like Elliots malware scraped passwords from the host and put them into a innocuous looking /dev/nu11 folder (normall on a unix/linux host this is meant to look like the dev/null folder which you can send any amounts of crap to and it'll just vanish)
in the folder is a keylog of events, first someone is typing an internal address, then the word garyhost, then they type their password but have to backspace a couple of times - therefore "huntr[BS]er3[BS]2" becomes "hunter2" =D
- 47m27s Seems like the Dark army infections are much greater than we saw before.

Dom shows off a bunch of tattoo's in this episode that I don't think we've seen before.  
It kind of looks like Dom's ID badge has a sim-card in it.  
Doms passcode has 456 in it. it goes, bottom left, 456, (perhaps 9), then two unseen numbers
