Preface
--

I don't wanan say much about the episode as it was very dramatic, and this is a story-spoiler free writeup. Arg-wise this was a really quiet episode - UNTIL THE END!... This also gave us some info that correlates to the filenames we've been seeing from Dom's computer. We now know that they could be related to cars. We also saw more maps, more ips, more car number plates,  More info below...

Observations
--

- 01m28s **Red, and Yellow** Rising sun postcard in the fish tank

- 17m09s **Sason Nori** - full name revealed(by agent Stancheck) of member of Fsociety that was previously arrested
- 21m39s **Moment of Truth** the song being played in the car by "Gang Starr"
- 22m51s Wanita Rosenberg - The woman Mobley had met on 23AndMe. (I wonder if that profile is real)
- 23m17s **1057** the code to Trentons's cuffs A nod to the guy (lost) who is helping/organising the ARG this year, he previously creates badge challenge, and hidden challenges, and your brain will explode challenge for the annual defcon computer conference in Las Vegas.
