Preface
-------

WOOO BOY was there ALOT in this episode that could be ARG related, and I mean alot. The first 10 minutes had an incredible amount of information in it. I've done my best to record as much relevant information as possible. Once I've finished this write up I will check in with the ARGSociety and see what I may have missed. 

This write up take a bit of a different turn than the first episode, which will be backported when I have some time. 
Firstly we'll start with the observations and follow that with screencaps from the episode to back them up. In addition, timestamps are included in case anyone wants to look them up in the episode, bear in mind the time for each viewer may be slightly different. 
You can also find all the screencaps (if needed) in the images folders. Special thanks to ColonelDox for their input, extra info  and double checking.

Preliminary Stuff from previous episodes
----------------------------------------
- 17 of 71 Facilities "This is where the paper records are going"
- Blueprints of the 'Evil' corp facility
- Facility 511 (Ground Floor)
- The manual being read is **ups_sumx640-service-manual**
- Elliot connects to (the femtocell) via **l4713116.e-corp.usa.com** (NB This link no longer seems to exist and simply redirects to www.usa.com)


Episode 2 Observations
----------------------

- (01:22) E-corp are setting up/have various other companies such as in the previous episode we saw e-corp estates, in this episode we see e-corp insurance
- (01:30) "Your Trash For 2 E-coin" 
- (01:40) E-corp building number is 901
- (01:45) We first see Elliots ID card and the **QR code** on it - we will see this card 4 times in the next sequence however one of those times the card is face up (3rd time) and all the others it is upside down
- (02:36) **https://www.trunkclub.com** - looks like a legit website, need to double check if it's part of the ARG or not
- (xx:xx) Poster advert for **"FALLERE"** on the tube
- (03:04) We see Elliot entering his e-corp password, it looks like it at least has the letters N and Y in it. It may be possible to do some statistical analysis on what looks like are the keys entered. However we see Elliots asterixed password several times this episode, and by the final time it looks like his password is 23 characters long, statistical analysis may not help unless we can observe a very large majority of it. In addition, it could be a common phrase, or something related to the show (e.g. fiveNinehacksoleet1337ynot?. Jury is currently out on this one. 
- (xx:xx) **l223u** -Elliot's desktop reveals a list of files, on the left hand side there is a network drive mapped with a username l223u
- (xx:xx) **BKNAPPLE** **ARGSociety Shout out** - his name is listed on the bottom file inside Elliot's "Recovery Effort" folder
- (03:14) **Full Ecorp address** revealed as **"901 E 57th Street, New York New York, 10022, Phone number (212)-555-0171** (This is a dead end street on google maps - https://goo.gl/maps/z2iB98xCwY92)
- (03:17) "Primo poon" is on the **31st Floor** - this can be linked to the Reddit posts found on 'inside_e_corp' subreddit, and we should be able to directly attribute the on-screen character to the username that posted a similar comment. (Primo Poon guy is most likely ![thefabledladyslayer](https://www.reddit.com/user/thefabledladyslayer) on the subreddit, due to his later comment in the episode about an instance with a lady)
- (03:23) **Map** of E-corp Active US Storage Facilities - links to map theory/Geological stuff being a big impact in this seasons ARG.
- (03:56) **E-corp Employee Heirarchy** (at least for Elliots Department) 
- (04:18) **William Braddock details**: **william.braddock@e-corp-usa.com | aboynamedg00 | https://webmail.e-corp-usa.com/OWA** 
- (04:18) Tool "credential harvester" used to collect Braddock's details. I believe this is from SET (social engineers toolkit) which has been used previousl by Darlene and her munchkins in season 2. In case you're wondering where it is, run SET then choose options 1 (Social engineering attacks), 2 (Webiste attack Vectors), 3 (Credential Harvester Attack Method) - DISCLAIMER, I am not advocating the use of this software for anything other than legal ethical hacking, red-teaming, or personal education. 
- (04:21) List of William Braddocks inbox - For full names and email address please refer to subfolder
- (04:21) **HI COLIN** Ticketmaster email to William Braddock about his 'Goo Goo Dolls' tickets - so looks like either a) he uses a different login for ticketmaster OR b) someone else forwarded him on the tickets. 
- (04:21) One of the emails states that there will be 'Server Maintenance' next week
- (04:31) The picture behind Braddocks desk looks pretty odd, could possibly be some sort of <> cipher? 
- (04:33) The woman with the FBI from e-corp looks to be **Robyn/Bobby Fulltern** Not sure if her QR code can enhanced like Elliots. 
- (04:55) **www.e-corp-usa.com/cp/directory/shipping/108898** website for the e-corp logistics (Site now just shows and error page for Ecorp - more info in Sites folder)
- (xx:xx) EARL the driver states that he has come to "SIOUX FALLS"  South Dakota - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_Falls,_South_Dakota
- (05:58) **PETER MCCLEERY password **tapitback!** 
- (06:38) **ts1.e-corp-usa.com** looks like a production server for uploading new software to e-corp hardware
- (06:56) Assembly code for unit **apc_hw05** - personally I don't believe there's enough of this code to compile - there's a chance the hex on the right hand side has something hidden in it. I'll keep my ear to the ground but at the moment there's so many other things to investigate that I won't be trying to decode a bunch of stuff that looks legitimate. 
- (xx:xx) **K6F7241 - FTPplugin**
- (xx:xx) **$73 million** the amount of money E-corp looks to save if they followed Elliot's recovery plan. Is that 73 million in this new age of the dollar becoming worthless? cos that probably wouldn't even buy 5 apples in 6 months time. ;)
- (07:15) Elliots QR code/Id Badge upright
- (xx:xx) "Apples 3 for $25 or 5 e-coin"
- (07:57) Elliots Password looks to be 21 characters long
- (08:01) Elliots Password looks to be 23 characters long
- (xx:xx) **r/Inside_Evil_Corp** subreddit, howwever it's apparent that it's only through Elliot's eyes does the 'e' in 'e-corp' turn to 'evil' 
- (xx:xx) **217 Broadway, tel - 212-673-7260** Chinese restaurant address next to Elliot's apartment - This has probably been noticed several times before, the phone number doesn't have the classic "555" in the middle, so this could be a legit phone number/actual building. 
- (xx:xx) **207 Broadway** Elliot's address, for completeness his apartment number is 4E. 
- (09:48) Continuity easter egg? Is Elliot Crying in the exact same place that he was in season 1 episode 1 ?
- (10:04) Elliot gets his prescription from "Essex Street Pharmacy"

Phew that's the start of th episode complete. 
Let's see what else is in there!

- (18:29) **Vimeo Account** FBI Dom states that the NEW FSociety video has been posted to the same Vimeo account as the previous ones. 
- (19:57) Blurry shot of the FBI laptop screen
- (20:02) A Couple of interesting **files on the FBI laptop** - **288A-NY-84511326-ELSUR.txt** 
- (21:12) **H4G-B5FG** (could be O instead of G) Joanna Wellick's lover's (Derek) car registration looks like
- (xx:xx) **NUQ-1724** Joanna Wellick's car registration plate, it's a New York number plate, and her car is a 'surburban' model
- (23:58) Blood on the baby's head, I have certainly not screencapped this as I definitely do not think there is any secret code, or symbol being put there. 1) I don't think the producers would want us using that as a reference point or having to stare at it for hours on end to work it out, 2) I think it would be extremely difficult and time consuming to get a baby to stay still long enough to put a symbol in blood on it's head and make it look like a legitimate blood splatter at the same time.
- (38:13) "A Civilisation that leaves so many of it's citizens unsatisfied and drives them into revolt... " Einsten quote read by MR ROBOT 
- (xx:xx) **TERS THIS FALL** These are the only letters visible from the "Separation Anxiety" film poster that Elliot is sitting in front of on the metro.
- (xx:xx) **20:46** The time on Elliot's computer
- (42:55) tool **cnc_receiver.py** being utilised by the FBI to take screenshots of Elliots desktop 
- (44:01) White Rose Aide talks about the Congo "Lua al" Mine
- (44:44) **HRC-1362**  Car registration plate parked outside the FBI stakeout house
- (45:13) **DOJ_9431** Doj number of FBI laptop
- (xx:xx) "Imported Kamora Coffee Liquer" on Dom's mug
- (xx:xx) **08:01** Time on Elliots computer
- (45:24) **ThePlague@ukvev0hfruxcqvjst1c.net**
- (45:24) **eugenebelford@q09orkldvfvsqq.net**
- (xx:xx) Although the previous two emails are .net addresses they look kinda like.onion addresses
- (45:30)**sandbox.vflsruxm.net/plans.rar** rar file Elliot uses to lure FBI into opening 
- (46:16) The PGP'd version of Elliots email - This definitely doesn't come from the files listed and as it is in it's orginal format is not a valid PGP Message. Why? Because...
- (46:16) **CRAMBO** , **BESKONE**, **CARNAGEINCARNATE** from **ARGSocity** reddit names in the PGP message

Well that was a lot. Lets go have some fun with it all!


Extra Interesting Stuff
-----------------------

Reddit names from people that contributed greatly to solving the ARG from season 2 were seen in this episode. Check notes above, or pictures below for confirmation. 

Namely -  BKNAPPLE, CRAMBO, BESKONE, & CARNAGEINCARNATE (in that order)

Elliots Birthday is mentioned in this episode,  we can try and pinpoint what date it is from various emails that have timestamps e.g. Peter MCcleerey's email dated August 4th 2015, and from the timestamps the FBI pictures are using while they monitor him.

Currently we can place Elliots birthday at least between August 4th - 18th September. (needs more work)

**ThePlague** responds to email - I won't spoil it here just yet in case you want to do it, but it is a huge easter suggesting that ThePlague is the same guy from the film Hackers And his 'real name' (as a movie character was) **Eugene Belford** hahaha. This is an awesome easter egg, well done Mr Robot Team! But wait there's more - in line with this seasons **"Spot The Difference"** theme, the response from the plague talks about the 4 most commonly used passwords, a very similar line said in the movie by the same character. However in the movie he only mentions 3 of the most commonly used passwords, the anomaly is the addition of "secret" as one. This rabbit hole goes deeper, we may be seeing "secret" used as a password somewhere down/across/up the line.

Investigations
--------------

- **OPEN** Began investigating r/Inside_e_corp - created a user and need to create separate site page.
- **OPEN** call the Chinese takeaway number.
-
- **OPEN** put number plates into car registration checker (needs link) and document results.
- **OPEN** ColonelDox has done some work with the plans.rar file, need to catch up and see what the situation is.

- **TENTATIVE** Tried to log into the mail server with William Braddock & Peter Mccleery login details. Error codes came out. Please see SITES folder ![webmail.e-corp-usa.com](../../Sites/webmail.e-corp-usa.com) for further information.

- **CLOSED** Checked out https://www/trunkclub.com it IS a legit website - not ARG related.
- **CLOSED** Google Mapped E-corp address - just shows a dead end (ironic?) information updated above.
- **CLOSED** Cross referenced reddit post to character and his behaviour - looks likely to be "thefabledslayer" - information above updated.
- **CLOSED** "Su falls" should be Sioux Falls, South Dakota - information above updated.
- **CLOSED** Emailed The Plague and Eugenebelford - The plague domain exists, gets a response - have updated above in Extra Interesting Stuff 
- **CLOSED** Find Vimeo Account - https://vimeo.com/wearefsociety

TODO
====
- Fix some timestamps
- ~~I have heard of someone successfully sharpening Elliots QR code to get another ARG site out of it, I would like to try this myself but I dont think I have the necessary image skills - so need to track down the sharpened image, and give credit to the originator~~
   ColonelDox has done this and added result (www.e-corp-usa.com/company_directory/elliot_alderson)  - Write up is in SITES ![www.e-corp-usa.com](https://github.com/z3r07h/Mr-R0B0T-s03-ARG/blob/master/Sites/www.e-corp-usa.com)
- EMAIL ALL THE THINGS, all of the e-corp heirarchy and all the people seen in William Braddocks and co's emails. 
- Try to find out why William Braddock is called COLIN by ticketmaster
- Confirm FULLTERN's first name, and find out if QR code can be enhanced
- Get proper name of where the warehouse is that EARL has delivered stuff to. (Su Falls) ??? - Souix Falls - Location updated on Mr robot map
- Find Screenshot for K6F7241 evidence
- Confirm Joanna Wellick's lover's (Derek) car registration plate
- Find the book the Freud quote is from
- Find correct name for the Congo mine White Rose's aide speaks about
- Investigate plans.rar file (Colonel Dox has already cracked part of this so catch up with them and see if anything more can be done) - Dug all the way down and turned base64 into a file which in turn held another QR code - will do write up later. 
  - Base64 -> QR code -> https://github.com/RedBalloonShenanigans/MonitorDarkly (CD notes.md - will update progress there until addition of new site folder) --
  - Zeroth - This Tool looks to be what the FBI are using to monitor Elliots monitor, at first glance there is a command cnc_display.py which is very similar to cnc_receiver.py seen in the episode. Need to move this to Sites/something for the rar file/investigations when the folder is created
- Do some more researching into When Elliot's birthday is. 
- Hyperlink (same page) timeline to screenshots.
