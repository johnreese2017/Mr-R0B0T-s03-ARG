Preface
-------

So on the surface, this episode didn't seem to hold a ton of information (with regard to easter eggs)

However, before this episode launched there was an E-coin perk that was the first page of the script to the episode.  
In the script the last section of the page is all redacted with black.  
The reason this is probably more important than it seems is that the perk almost directly hints that the script of this episode will be important.  
Therefore on further inspection there are a couple of extra interesting pieces of the episode that stand out.

There's some extra screenshots taken, purely from curiosity. I'll keep them around on the tiny chance they mean something later on. 

P.s. THere is a **LOT of MUSIC** in this episode (I haven't even documented it all yet)

ok lets get cracking.

Preliminary stuff from previous episodes
----------------------------------------

- Elliot using a root login to start the 5-9 hack from Tyrells Ecorp computer **bkuw300ps345672-cs30.serverfarm.evil-corp-usa.com** (remember this adddress is probably just e-corp-usa.com as it's currently being seen through Elliot's eyes)
- Joanna/Tyrell Wellicks Address revealed as **298 West 25th Street, New York, NY 10001**
 

Episode 3 Observations
----------------------

- The gun handed to Tyrell looks to have some information on the side of it
- There's some large X's on the Fsociety security shutters. 
- The Desktop Ellio is on while commiting the 5-9 hack
- There's a book with strange symbols down it's spine behind Tyrell at his 'safe' house
- The interviewer getting high while interviewing Tyrell writes some strange symbols down, perhaps by accident, perhaps on purpose. 
- **https://192.251.68.238** Address Tyrell's baby cam is on
- We see somne images of E-corp buildings being targeted for 5-9
- Tyrell also has an interest in Maps - seems like they keep popping up
- (**Red | Green | Blue **) Tyrell using distinct colours in his network topology diagrams
- **Car number plate** Behind Cisco when he gives the femtocell to dark army
- **rvzjtenpula.net** is a domain being used as an 'implant callback address' in the exploit code being used witfh the femtocell
- We see a topology diagram of what the 5-9 attack will be targetting
- **Sue Dragel** is an author of an article on Joanna Wellick - the article is hosted at **https://nypost.com/2015/06/17_Five_Nine_the_curious_case_oj_joanna_wellick_...**
- **Haley Macteal** is an author of an article on Joanna Wellick for OK magazine online
- **Deuteronomy 23:1** quoted by Tyrell Wellick to Irving, "No one who has been emasculated by crushing or cutting may enter the assembly of the Lord" - This jibe at Irving was pretty deep and I think he was basically calling him a Jew in a derogatory way.. Maybe not.. but if so it was a pretty hilarious way to try and insult someone. 
- At roughly the same time as the Deuteronomy quote Tyrell is Whistling an interesting tune (TODO find out what this is)
- **Tom Wingfield's Country Store** is the shop Tyrell passes as he attempts his escape
- **MG72A59** **NJ** Police car plate
- **382** is the policeman's precint number (as it's on his police hat)
- **"I could have gotta here sooner if you just gave me the address - had to solve a f"$!ing math problem to figure it out** FBI guy says to Irving in the safe house just after he says "You guys and your damn puzzles" - Irving is dunking a tea bag into his "#1 dad" cup at the time. I find this line to be of particular note and feels like a direct poke at the ARG community, especially if we consider this episode to be more concerned with the script. 
- Irving is writing a novel called "Beach Towel" He is currently on chapter 4 "  A Wink Gone Wrong" - Theres a chance for a capital letter cipher to be hidden here, needs investigating. 
- **MEATY DAMN HANDS** - just funny, the show seems to zoom in on it for some reason. 
- **FUKAN HOTEL** is where Tyrell is staying before meeting Elliot, The hotel building number is **261**
- **2X74** the taxi number that Elliot and Tyrell meet in
