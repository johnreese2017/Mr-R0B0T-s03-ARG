Preface
-------

So on the surface, this episode didn't seem to hold a ton of information (with regard to easter eggs)

However, before this episode launched there was an E-coin perk that was the first page of the script to the episode./
In the script the last section of the page is all redacted with black./
The reason this is probably more important than it seems is that the perk almost directly hints that the script of this episode will be important/
Therefore on further inspection there are a couple of extra interesting pieces of the episode that stand out./

P.s. THere is a LOT of MUSIC in this episode

ok lets get cracking. 

Preliminary stuff from previous episodes
----------------------------------------

- Elliot using a root login to start the 5-9 hack from Tyrells Ecorp computer **bkuw300ps345672-cs30.serverfarm.evil-corp-usa.com** (remember this adddress is probably just e-corp-usa.com as it's currently being seen through Elliot's eyes)
- Joanna/Tyrell Wellicks Address revealed as **298 West 25th Street, New York, NY 10001**
 

Episode 3 Observations
----------------------

- The gun handed to Tyrell looks to have some information on the side of it
- There's some large X's on the Fsociety security shutters. 
- The Desktop Ellio is on while commiting the 5-9 hack
- There's a book with strange symbols down it's spine behind Tyrell at his 'safe' house
- The interviewer getting high while interviewing Tyrell writes some strange symbols down, perhaps by accident, perhaps on purpose. 
- **https://192.251.68.238** Address Tyrell's baby cam is on
- We see somne images of E-corp buildings being targeted for 5-9
- Tyrell also has an interest in Maps - seems like they keep popping up
- (**Red | Green | Blue **) Tyrell using distinct colours in his network topology diagrams
- **Car number plate** Behind Cisco when he gives the femtocell to dark army
- **rvzjtenpula.net** is a domain being used as an 'implant callback address' in the exploit code being used witfh the femtocell
- We see a topology diagram of what the 5-9 attack will be targetting
- **Sue Dragel** is an author of an article on Joanna Wellick - the article is hosted at **https://nypost.com/2015/06/17_Five_Nine_the_curious_case_oj_joanna_wellick_...**
- **Haley Macteal** is an author of an article on Joanna Wellick for OK magazine online
- **Deuteronomy 23:1** quoted by Tyrell Wellick to Irving, "No one who has been emasculated by crushing or cutting may enter the assembly of the Lord" - This jibe at Irving was pretty deep and I think he was basically calling him a Jew in a derogatory way.. Maybe not.. but if so it was a pretty hilarious way to try and insult someone. 
- At roughly the same time as the Deuteronomy quote Tyrell is Whistling an interesting tune (TODO find out what this is)
- **Tom Wingfield's Country Store** is the shop Tyrell passes as he attempts his escape
- **MG72A59** **NJ** Police car plate
- **382** is the policeman's precint number (as it's on his police hat)
- **"I could have gotta here sooner if you just gave me the address - had to solve a f"$!ing math problem to figure it out** FBI guy says to Irving in the safe house just after he says "You guys and your damn puzzles" - Irving is dunking a tea bag into his "#1 dad" cup at the time. I find this line to be of particular note and feels like a direct poke at the ARG community, especially if we consider this episode to be more concerned with the script. 
- Irving is writing a novel called "Beach Towel" He is currently on chapter 4 "  A Wink Gone Wrong" - Theres a chance for a capital letter cipher to be hidden here, needs investigating. 
- **MEATY DAMN HANDS** - just funny, the show seems to zoom in on it for some reason. 
- **FUKAN HOTEL** is where Tyrell is staying before meeting Elliot, The hotel building number is **261**
- **2X74** the taxi number that Elliot and Tyrell meet in


Interesting Stuff
-----------------

- There's an E-corp employee called Eric Macteal, there's a slim chance that character and Haley Macteal have some sort of connection
- **The death of Peaches San-do the midget, at the hands or rather the feet of ----- elephant...a tragedy at Madison square garden**Irving listens to some pretty weird shit **Death likes it hot by Gor Vedale??
- Music at 25m00 approx 
- Tyrell whistling at 30m16s approx
- Music at 10m52s approx when credits roll at start of ep
- Music at 30m38s approx sounds like Cypress Hill
- Music at 31m20s approx outside the general store
- Music at 39m27s approx at Irvings car place
- Music at 42m06s approx when Tyrell leaves the safe house
