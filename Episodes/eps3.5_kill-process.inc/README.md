Preface
--
Again quite a quiet episode for ARG stuff - some bits of interesting things to investigate, looks like a few sites we've seen before and maybe a new file to delve into. As always.. Here we go..

Observations
--

- 01m35s "Back the future" cartoon on television - theme tune with lyrics "Going back in time"
- 01m35s **3 U.S.A map puzzles** Jigsaw puzzle box on the top of the telelvision.
- 01m35s Videos on the table top - FYI they are - **Pump up the Volume (1990)**, **Lost boys (1987)**, **A Princess Bride** - Which should be **The** princess bride **(1987)**, **Mystic Pizza (1988)**, **She's out of control (1989)**, **Pretty Woman (1990)**. Some other classics from the era are in the shelf underneath including: The mighty Ducks, Sister Act, Uncle Buck, Mrs Doubtfire, Dirty Dancing, and My Cousin Vinny.
- 11m52s **104912** Road sign
- 13m11s **FBI Notice Board** comes into focus after Dom and her partner leave
- 13m43s **The Mar-A-Lago Club** 
- 16m39s **B823710** NYPD vehicle ID
- 16m52s - 222, and 17, helmet numbers of fireman (the previous number is weird/unreadable)
- 17m39s **Eric Ralbern** Security guard who elliot steals an ID from (no QR code on this one- more info from badge in Extra Shots)
- 18m56s Weird fish on the wall of the conference room
- 19m17s **upsadmin** login elliot is using for computer **K6F7241** (this computer name comes up ALOT)
- 19m17s **4CA9CAE6** RSA key ID
- 19m17s **eps_hw_dev@e-corp-usa.com** email address
- 19m17s **https://192.251.68.232/files/ups_640_patch.zip** IP address/Sister
- 19m17s **NBOGOVICH** RSA key ID
- 19m17s **192.251.68.229** IP address (used for Scp)
- 20m18s **4X98** Taxi number
- 21m17s **green, yellow** lighters on the table, weird puzzle, REX cigarettes box. Maybe the barcodes on the lighters can be enhanced?
- 21m33s **Evidence file** - 288A-NY-ROUIX-22381_evi_log_22.pdf - this time it shows a list of things confiscated from fun-society, see screenshot for list. We saw a similar file in eps3.1_undo on Doms laptop but these are not the same files. ($4.78 in change was found at the scene)
- 24m11s **HRA9510** car plate
- 24m11s **105537** roadsign number
- 24m18s **rt_admin** username Elliot logs onto E-corp network with
- 24mm31s **Matt Mitchell** - **PD511326** - contact details on screenshot
- 26m44s **192.251.68.242** - on the PuTTY screen we also see 192.251.68.229 later, need to double check if this has been seen before
- 26m58s **9C2FA3D1** Elliots RSA key (different this time)
- 30m29s **Kaitlin Doubleday** in a play called Repulsion - interesting because Portia Doubleday is part of the cast for the show.
- 31m43s Barcodes on Red-wheelbarrow stock (Probably just equate to the number 62 36 000 which is on the boxes)
- 32m02s **Cred 22958** number DOM quotes to emergency services
- 38m59s Ecorp Barcodes on folders
- 44m15s **GXG5775** number plate
- 44m24s **JAZZKEYS** number plate
