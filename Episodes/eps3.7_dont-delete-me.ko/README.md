Preface
--

In the wake of episode 7 we are left we a pale faced Elliot and a young looking Christian Anderson to being the tale of how Elliot is going to deal with..... JUST KIDDING No story here. This episode was kinda spiritual though I would recommend checking it out before going through the evidence.

One thing of note, and *especially* highlighted by the drug dealer with the suitcase, there are **a lot** of 3 digit numbers in this episode. See below for a collation of them. I have kept the decimal places in for the readme, however removed and turned them into a 3 digit list contained in the file "3_Digits_from_ep8"
