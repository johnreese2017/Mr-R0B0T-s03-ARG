eps3.4_runtime-error.r00
========================

Preface
-------

A very interesting episode in retrospect. What makes it particular amazing IMO is that the entire episode is shot in one take! This does pose a bit of a problem with camera focus for a lot of elements such as employee names. However, the focus is definite sharp in places it needs to be in order to facilitate the ARG.

Interesting
-----------

- Fred Watson has a thing for Bernie (Sanders) could be a good angle for a password attempt
- Lots of floor numbers
- some other interesting numbers from Elliot's instructions **23-148**, **022350**
- par login - **zlon0101**
- Frank Bowman's password - **hidd3nlynx** is a reference to a hacker group (a serious hacker group) more info: https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/hidden-lynx-professional-hackers-hire
- There is a taxi in this episode (2 actually) before the coin riot starts, but the number is far to unfocused to read. 
- Ecorp extension numbers - Safety Hotline **3401**, ID help desk hotline **2219**, E corp security **791**
- The internal audit team is from DETROIT
- The codenames used by Irvings and Angela directly correspond to security researcher **Moxie Marlinspike** whom mainly deals with security of communications - pretty cool since they're using a phone at the time. More info on MM can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxie_Marlinspike, https://moxie.org/, https://github.com/moxie0
- a Marlinspike is also a type of knot, since MM has a mariners license his psuedonym is probably derived from this.
