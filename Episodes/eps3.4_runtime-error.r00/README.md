Preface
-------

A very interesting episode in retrospect. What makes it particular amazing IMO is that the entire episode is shot in one take! This does pose a bit of a problem with camera focus for a lot of elements such as employee names. However, the focus is definite sharp in places it needs to be in order to facilitate the ARG.
