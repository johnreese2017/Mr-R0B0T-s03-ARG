Lists
==

This is a collection of lists for ease of reading/quick access/reference. They'll be updated as each episode reveals some more. 

**5,6,8** digit numbers are self explanatory

**Car number plates** All vehicle registrations seen in the show (including, cars, taxis, police vehicles, etc)

**Emails list** all e-corp email addresses and other addresses, such as 'theplague' seen in episodes.

**Employees list** E-corp employees in the form firstname.lastname which can be used for various enumeration tasks

**List of E-Corp Employees** Full list of ecorp employees seen in the show, roughly where they are in the e-corp heirarchy, and additional info like related IDs, passwords, revealed by the show.

**IP addresses and sites** all the IPs and sites seen in the show (not necessarily discovered through the ARG)

**Other strings** Various miscellaneous strings such as hostname "K6F7241" and other weird strings seen in episodes. 

NB. Bit dissapointed with the car registration numbers. I have put them all through Burp->Intruder, via pitchfork mode and the only two that give any results from the car registration site  have been listed. I was expecting alot more.
