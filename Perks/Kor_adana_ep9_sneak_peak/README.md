Preface
--
Kor adana gives a small introduction about changes that will be coming up at e-corp as well as including a sneak peak of episode 9. THe sneak peak is Elliot and Darlene talking. The files and screenshots are in their respective folders (in files you'll find the video file which can be played with vlc player, and an mp3 version for audio only).
I'm not great with audio/images so I have only done a basic spectrogram analysis using Audacity, perhaps someone else will have a better way to make the image clearer. 

Observation

Before and after Kor speaks, there's a tell-tell sign that something is not quite right with the audio. We've seen/heard this done before in the ARG and it's also a technique that has been used in several CTF (capture the flag) competitions.

After Kor speaks the sound you hear is actually the sound of a picture being hidden in the audio. The Mr Robot team have hidden another cat in the audio!

Before Kor speaks there's a similar sound but doesn't look like there's an image hidden, perhaps something else is.
