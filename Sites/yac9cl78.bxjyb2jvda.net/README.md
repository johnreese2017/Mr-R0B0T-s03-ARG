Description
--

This site came from eps3.5_kill_process however we see some other ups commands from a preliminary episode at the start of ep3.4

We are presented with a terminal shell from K6F7241 ssh'ing as upsadmin into the ups management system. 
The login is automatic and then we are presented with a ups user prompt with which we currently have access to three commands:
- **help**  Shows a list of possible commands
- **cfgpower**  which can take a parameter of '-all' and spits out some power information
- **upsfwupdate**  which can take a parameter of '-status' or '-lastresult' to confirm when the last firmware update had been activated. 

Other commands we've seen before - detstatus & cfgshutdn - Neither of these commands work in the console

**Main Shell**
