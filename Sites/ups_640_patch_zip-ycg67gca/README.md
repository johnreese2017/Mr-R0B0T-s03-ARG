Description
--

The site goes to an entire page filled with base64. We can assume that this base64 is a representation of the file ups_640_patch.zip

The base64 file is in files

Investigation

I thought this would as simple as changing the extension and opening the file. 
I know that Winzip can usually open any zip that's in base64 format, so I installed winzip to a VM but that didn't work
I tried to decode the result of decoding the first set of base64 and unzipping that, but to no avail. 

Possibly could be part of a bigger zip file? since you can patch base64 zips together - I'll have to come back to this one
