The login is done automatically and then a password is requested.  
password is **z1on0101**

Extra output can be acquired by entering the PED instructions afterwards:

After entering 022350 you will get a Key confirmation of:

The numerical part can be transcoded as letters (01=A, 02=B, etc) into:
