Description
---

This is an interactive shell meant to represent the CSAT server that Angela manipulates in episode3.4_runtime_error.

The login is done automatically and then a password is requested. The only problem is that the password is never included in the Instructions that we see in episode 3.4 (tried zlon0101, hidd3nlynx, secret, and 022350)
