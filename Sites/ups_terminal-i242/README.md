Description
--

This actually looks like it's just from season 2 ARG  - either that or they're reusing the domain for some odd reason, the IP ending .242 was previously being used for a confictura industries website, which was very much a part of season 2 ARG and a little at the start of season 3. 

We're presented with a terminal session on computer K6F7241 and we are automatically logged in as upsadmin. 

We can run a couple of commands that we see from episode eps3.5_kill-process

- "unzip ups_fw_patch.zip"
- "gpg --verify hashes.asc"
- "sha256sum --check hashes.asc"

and we get the same result as we saw in the episode.
