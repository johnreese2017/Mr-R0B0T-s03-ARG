**UPDATE: 5th December 2017 22:04** Not sure when it has happened but Elliots Personnel number has been removed from the page. It no longer displays 072391 under his name - Suspicious - So now I've gotta wonder if there were other numbers for other profiles that have also gone missing - might need to check on internetarchive

**There are results for:**
- elliot_alderson
- angel_moss
- linda_spencer
- samar_swailem
- frank_bowman

Investigations
---------------

The main page also contains a search bar, this can be used to find other employees - and shows results on an interactive page. The sections 'Marketing' and 'Legal' simply have an error.  elliot, angela, linda, samar, and frank are found within the other sections.
