With regard to the mask.png file - looking at the file, it's very large, with a size of 6582 by 8192. however, the image is pixelated on purpose. this is because it's hiding a message in the tile below the mask's "mouth". the message reads "If you can't look on the bright side, then I will sit with you in the dark.". this is a quote from Alice in Wonderland
