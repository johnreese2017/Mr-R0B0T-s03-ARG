Information
--

This site (seen in episode 9) is just a base32/base64 text only page.

For sake of organisation the entire text can be found in the file 'base64'

Investigation
--

This file has a PK header, meaning it's a form of ZIP file.

I may be doing something wrong but this file cannot just be extracted straight as a zip file. Therefore maybe we need to add the previous partial zip file (theory) to the end of it.
