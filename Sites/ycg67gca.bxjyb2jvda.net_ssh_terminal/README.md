This site is from ep3.4_runtime_error

A terminal screen that is Elliot loggin into the elkbox (automatically) to check the logstash logs

- We can use 'ls' command to list directory contents
- We can follow /usr/local/logstash-ups to see an entire list of logstash log results
- There is a /home path but it does not contain anything AFAIK

**Main Shell**

**Logstash logs**
