 (**CREDITS willdroid8** - figured out if you added additional 9 to the end brings up login in page for shipping site - Thank you, and Thanks ColonelDox for the update!)

First seen in ep3.1_undo.gz when Elliot is hatching his recovery plan

Information
-----------

This is the shipping web-app that Elliot uses to redirect E-corp backups to a facility in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

The source has a bunch of javascript in it, but this looks to be for "new relic" which is a piece of analytics software, similar to kibana if you've heard of that. I'm not sure why at this point NBC would want heavy amount of logging done on this page/site, but maybe we'll find out.
