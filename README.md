# Mr-R0B0T-s03-ARG

Last Updated: Wed 22 Nov 00:53:58 GMT 2017

A writeup for things found and theories regarding the Mr Robot Season 3 ARG

This is a living document and will seek to layout observations and investigations made into the Season 3 ARG. This is not a description of the story, nor how the story and ARG may interact.

Layout
------

**Episodes** folder contains what will mostly be the s0urce information.
Inside Each episode will be a list of findings, theories, links found, pictures, QR codes, etc, basically everything that COULD be ARG related. The readme for each one will list what has been found, investigated, results, and conclusions.

**Sites** folder contains sites and links found from Episode / Other investigation
Each ARG Site will have its own subdirectory, along with a readme to include the conclusions, and theories, backup scripts and tools as necessary, and notes as just a personal account of some things that may be out of the ordinary.  

**Emails** folder contains replies from all characters/email addresses seen in the show

**License_Plates** folder contains results from car searches using the nyspcjis.net site and car number plates/taxi numbers seen in the show

The list of Ecorp employees will be updated as more and more employees are identified in each episod


Overarching Theory
------------------

This season's ARG started with two new PDFs from redwheelbarrow.com\

These were two childrens activities, 'Spot The Difference', and 'Color By Numbers' (please see the redwheelbarrow folder under SITES for more info on these)\

Including these there are 3 very prominent themes so far in this season's ARG\

**Spotting the difference**
This could be spotting the difference on a website, or between a site seen on the show and seen IRL. Even spotting the difference in responses from ARG characters.

**Color By Numbers**
In the first instance the colors referenced certain alphabet letters, and so certain parts of the color By Numbers activity spelt out hints (such as SHES NOT SANE)\
This could be a large clue that certain colors this season, or the use of colors may need to be translated to numbers/letters/clues/codes/etc

**Geological and Geographical Locations**
The reddit threads on REALMysterSpot indicate a number of locations in the United States\
Other Geological sites such as Sioux Falls, and the Mine in the congo White Rose want's to get his/her hands on seem to be key pieces of the story. Thus they could also be key pieces of the ARG

**Numbers**
There's alot of 6 digit numbers coming up this season (and some 5 digit ones).  


To facilitate better ARG organisation I will begin to collate major incidents of locations, numbers, usernames/passwords into easy accessible files.
